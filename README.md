# Collaborative Reinforcement Learning for Fishing Without Rope

## Introduction

This project aims to explore and demonstrate the application of advanced reinforcement learning techniques, specifically Double Deep Q-Networks (DDQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), in a collaborative environment. The scenario focuses on the challenging task of fishing without the use of ropes, requiring agents to learn cooperation and effective strategies to achieve their goals.

## Background

In traditional fishing methods, ropes and nets are fundamental. However, this project imagines a scenario where such tools are unavailable, pushing the boundaries of what is possible through learned behaviors and collaboration among agents. This setup not only tests the limits of DDQN and PPO algorithms but also contributes to the broader field of reinforcement learning by exploring unconventional tasks.

## Objectives

- Implement DDQN and PPO algorithms from scratch.
- Design a simulated environment where agents can interact, collaborate, and perform the task of fishing without ropes.
- Evaluate the performance, efficiency, and learning progression of agents trained with DDQN and PPO in a collaborative setting.
- Analyze the strategies developed by the agents and how they adapt to the constraints of the task.
